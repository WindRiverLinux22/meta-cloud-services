SUMMARY = "Object-oriented filesystem paths"
DESCRIPTION = "pathlib offers a set of classes to handle filesystem paths. \
It offers the following advantages over using string objects: \
- No more cumbersome use of os and os.path functions. \
- Embodies the semantics of different path types. \
- Well-defined semantics, eliminating any warts or ambiguities. \
